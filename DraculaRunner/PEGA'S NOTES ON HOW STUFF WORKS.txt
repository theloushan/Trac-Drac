TO GALTORN OR CORY OR WHOEVER IS READING THIS:

here is what I figured out while working on this from like midnight to 4 am
===============================================================================
collision for damage/indicators need some major parts

FIRST
need an area2d under the character that's bigger than its hitbox
hitbox is necessary for moving the kinematic body
area2d necessary to register interactions with other area2d nodes

SECOND
set a signal from the character's area2d going to the parent character
this will send the native area2d functions to the parent for interpretting when it hits stuff
for this game, we're passing "_on_Area2D_body_entered(body)" since it allows us to check the collided object's group

THIRD
under the node tab on the right for each "obstacle" and "sunlight" node set the group
can see what the groups are by clicking "manage groups"
just type the group you want to add it to and click the add button, don't do it through manage groups
this denotes what type of object the collider is

FOURTH
under the "_on_Area2D_body_entered(body)" function, use "if body.is_in_group("GROUPNAME")" to check the object
the overall func will fire off when the character collides with ANY Area2D node
the if statement will check the collided Area2D and will execute the contained code if it matches the specific group

FIFTH
write the code for whatever you need it to do when it hits that particular object
the only things we really need to worry about is decrementing health during those collisions
I also made the end point of the map a "finish" Area2D, so we know when the player reaches the end
Maybe can write some code to switch the player to the Standing anim at that point? Up to you guys

SIXTH - VERY IMPORTANT
go over each object that is going to have collisions
set them each to whatever layers they should be placed on
set layers by going to the right side under the Inspector tab for the Kinematic node (Character, SunlightK, etc)
look under "Collision" under the "PhysicsBody2D" section there
layers can be named in "Project Settings" on the top of the screen
set the "Layer" setting to the specific layer that the node exists on
set the "Mask" setting to the specific node type you want to collide with
so for the character, it's on the "player" layer and should mask to the "obstacle", "sunlight", and "finish" layers
for the obstacles, it should be on the "obstacle" layer and should mask to the "player" layer
this tells the engine that this object should only collide with objects on the respective layers
COLLISION WILL NOT WORK UNLESS YOU DO THIS
==================================================================================
getting music working

FIRST
create an "AudioStreamPlayer" node in the scene
if doing sound effects or positional audio, use "AudioStreamPlayer2D" or "AudioStreamPlayer3D" instead

SECOND
load the audio file in the "Inspector" tab in the "Stream" section

THIRD
check the box next to "Autoplay" in the "Inspector" tab
audio is ALREADY loaded for the level music, have it set to not play atm, just check "Autoplay" and it'll run
